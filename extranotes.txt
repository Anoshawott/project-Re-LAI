- create if statement that returns last recorded value
if the number is not recognised

- NOTE: coins crashed at 2549 that is couldn't recognise
2551 for some reason...

isolate problem with kda cannot detect numbers 
correctly --> NEED TO FIX!!

COINS:
x = 838
y = 715
w = 43
h = 

CS:
x = 1195
y = 14
w = 14
h =15

KDA:
x = 1140
y = 14
w = 33
h = 16

LEVEL:
x = 427
y = 709
w = 24
h = 23

HP:
x = 588
y = 696
w = 25
h = 14

DISTANCE (mini-map):
x = 1276
y = 713
w = 187
h = 186

TIME: (needs reward/punshiment no image recog. needed)?

- Plan which metrics to keep so to optimize ai -- FIXED!




- Plan how to determine distance between objects on map
so to optimize on player position to final end point!
	
	- Maybe can get turret positions from moving 
	player to turret in tests!!!!

	- Have better integration for player detect in 
	detect function so more efficient and less clunky
	code. --> have "last parameter" to return last 
	seen x and y coordinates of player
	- idea for turret detection --> have them only 
	detected at the given pixel coordinates 
	of each turret on the lane being faced against and 
	identify state from the image of how it looks 
	--> once closer to the turret based on player
	relative to the turret TURRET DETECTION SWITCHES
	OFF TO GIVE TURRET HP DATA AT TOP LEFT.
	- PROBLEM!!!!!! --> HOW TO ASSESS CHAMPION HP -->
	ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO REWARD THE AI FOR 
	ATTACKING CHAMPIONS --> POSSIBLE SOLUTION: detect
	position of the enemy level sign above the player
	and then do some simple pixel plus or minus pixel
	calculations to locate position of hp bar and then
	count the number of green pixels as an indicator
	of total hp available (don't forget but will need
	to decide how to determine current hp if the total
	bar is covered --> DETECT THE ENTIRE STATUS BAR 
	NOT JUST FROM THE LEVEL BOX, ensures the whole bar
	can be seen).

	- Once the above has been determined may start
	model construction... (HOPEFULLY by MONDAY?)

	- Optimize coin check --> only need to check every
	40 seconds or so?
